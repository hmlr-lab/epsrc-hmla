In contrast, Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL), a type of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), can generate complex logic programs from just a single positive example and minimal background knowledge, without prior extensive training. This approach offers a human-centered form of machine learning that is more controllable, reliable, and comprehensible due to its small training data size and the inherent interpretability of logic programs.

                            <p>"One-shot learning" traditionally refers to classifying a single instance using a machine learning model pre-trained on extensive datasets. In contrast, Meta-Interpretive Learning (MIL), a type of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), can generate complex logic programs from just a single positive example and minimal background knowledge, without prior extensive training. This approach offers a human-centered form of machine learning that is more controllable, reliable, and comprehensible due to its small training data size and the inherent interpretability of logic programs. We use PyGol, a novel implementation of MIL based on Meta Inverse Entailment (MIE), and compare its performance with ExpGen-PPO, a leading Deep Reinforcement Learning system ...</p>
